## Neraca APIs

Neraca is a legal service application to help people fight for their rights in court. This API is deployed on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). In making the RESTful APIs we use [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en) with some depedencies which are [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/), [JSON Web Token(JWT)](https://jwt.io/), and [NodeMailer](https://nodemailer.com/). 

The API consists of four main endpoints that provide different functions:

1. Authentication/Authorization APIs
2. Advocat APIs
